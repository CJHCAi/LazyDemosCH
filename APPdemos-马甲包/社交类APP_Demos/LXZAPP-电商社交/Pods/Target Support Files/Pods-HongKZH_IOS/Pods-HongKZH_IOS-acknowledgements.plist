##Overview

Using `CNTreeNode` is a convenient and easy way to build a tree of nested objects. You can use it as a datasource for your table view, source view or what ever.


##Installation
####Via CocoaPods
Just add `pod 'CNTreeNode'` to your podfile.


####Via Drag&amp;Drop
Just drag the `CNTreeNode.*` files into your project.


##Requirements
`CNTreeNode` was written using ARC and should run on 10.7 / iOS 6 and above.


##Contribution
The code is provided as-is, and it is far off being complete or free of bugs. If you like this component feel free to support it. Make changes related to your needs, extend it or just use it in your own project. Feedbacks are very welcome. Just contact me at [opensource@cocoanaut.com](mailto:opensource@cocoanaut.com?Subject=[CNTreeNode] Your component on Github), send me a ping on **Twitter** [@TheCocoaNaut](http://twitter.com/TheCocoaNaut) or **App.net** [@phranck](https://alpha.app.net/phranck). 

If you like this component or you're using it in your own software so please let me know. I'll give you a mention and set a link to your website (or the Mac App Store, if it exists).


##Documentation
You can find the complete reference [here (CocoaDocs)](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/CNTreeNode/).

			<string>If you are using FMDB in your project, I'd love to hear about it.  Let Gus know
by sending an email to gus@flyingmeat.com.

And if you happen to come across either Gus Mueller or Rob Ryan in a bar, you
might consider purchasing a drink of their choosing if FMDB has been useful to
you.
