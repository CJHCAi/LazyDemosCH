####Via Drag&Drop
Just drag the `CNTreeNode.*` files into your project.


##Requirements
`CNTreeNode` was written using ARC and should run on 10.7 / iOS 6 and above.


##Contribution

Make changes related to your needs, extend it or just use it in your own project. Feedbacks are very welcome. Just contact me at [opensource@cocoanaut.com](mailto:opensource@cocoanaut.com?Subject=[CNTreeNode] Your component on Github), send me a ping on **Twitter** [@TheCocoaNaut](http://twitter.com/TheCocoaNaut) or **App.net** [@phranck](https://alpha.app.net/phranck). 

If you like this component or you're using it in your own software so please let me know. I'll give you a mention and set a link to your website (or the Mac App Store, if it exists).


##Documentation
You can find the complete reference [here (CocoaDocs)](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/CNTreeNode/).


##License

might consider purchasing a drink of their choosing if FMDB has been useful to
you.
