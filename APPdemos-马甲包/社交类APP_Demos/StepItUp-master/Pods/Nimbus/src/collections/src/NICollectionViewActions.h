/**
 * The NICollectionViewActions class provides an interface for attaching actions to objects in a
 * NICollectionViewModel.
 *
 * <h2>Basic Use</h2>
 *
 * NICollectionViewModel and NICollectionViewActions cooperate to solve two related tasks: data
 * representation and user actions, respectively. A NICollectionViewModel is composed of objects and
 * NICollectionViewActions maintains a mapping of actions to these objects. The object's attached
 * actions are executed when the user interacts with the cell representing an object.
 *
 * <h2>Delegate Forwarding</h2>
 *
 * Your delegate implementation can call the listed collectionView: methods in order for the
 * collection view to respond to user actions. Notably shouldHighlightItemAtIndexPath: allows
 * cells to be highlighted only if the cell's object has an attached action.
 * didSelectItemAtIndexPath: will execute the object's attached tap actions.
 *
 * If you use the delegate forwarders your collection view's data source must be an instance of
 * NICollectionViewModel.
