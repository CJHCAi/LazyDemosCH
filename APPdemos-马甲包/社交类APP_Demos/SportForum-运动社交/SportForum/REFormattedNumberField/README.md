## Requirements
* Xcode 5 or higher
* Apple LLVM compiler
* iOS 6.0 or higher
* ARC

## Demo

Build and run the `REFormattedNumberFieldExample` project in Xcode to see `REFormattedNumberField` in action.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

The recommended approach for installating `REFormattedNumberField` is via the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) package manager, as it provides flexible dependency management and dead simple installation.
For best results, it is recommended that you install via CocoaPods >= **0.24.0** using Git >= **1.8.0** installed via Homebrew.

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

``` bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```

Change to the directory of your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/MyProject
$ touch Podfile
$ edit Podfile
```

Edit your Podfile and add REFormattedNumberField:

``` bash
platform :ios, '6.0'
pod 'REFormattedNumberField', '~> 1.1'
```

Install into your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

Open your project in Xcode from the .xcworkspace file (not the usual project file)

``` bash
$ open MyProject.xcworkspace
```

Please note that if your installation fails, it may be because you are installing with a version of Git lower than CocoaPods is expecting. Please ensure that you are running Git >= **1.8.0** by executing `git --version`. You can get a full picture of the installation details by executing `pod install --verbose`.

### Manual Install

All you need to do is drop `REFormattedNumberField` files into your project, and add `#include "REFormattedNumberField.h"` to the top of classes that will use it.

## Example Usage

Pretty much all you need is just to specify `format` NSString, where `X` are digits and all other characters are separators.

``` objective-c
REFormattedNumberField *phoneField1 = [[REFormattedNumberField alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(20, 20, 280, 30)];
phoneField1.format = @"(XXX) XXX-XXXX";
[self.view addSubview:phoneField1];

REFormattedNumberField *phoneField2 = [[REFormattedNumberField alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(20, 80, 280, 30)];
phoneField2.format = @"+X (XXX) XXX-XXXX";
[self.view addSubview:phoneField2];

REFormattedNumberField *ccField = [[REFormattedNumberField alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(20, 140, 280, 30)];
ccField.format = @"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX";
[self.view addSubview:ccField];

REFormattedNumberField *ccExpirationField = [[REFormattedNumberField alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(20, 200, 280, 30)];
ccExpirationField.format = @"XX/XX";
[self.view addSubview:ccExpirationField];
```
