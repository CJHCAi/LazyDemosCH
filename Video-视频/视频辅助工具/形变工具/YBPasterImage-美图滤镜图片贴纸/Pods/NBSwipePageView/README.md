# About NBSwipePageView

This is the same page view using in [iWeekly](http://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/iweekly-zhou-mo-hua-bao/id453405026) for the photo gallery view.

There are a lot of _TODOs_ in the project, since it's not finished yet. Although the basic functions are OK to use, things like re-order, add or delete pages with animation, etc still need more work.

Before I have time to finishe the project, I am not going to give any example to show how to use the project.

But as you can see, the project is very similar to UITableView, so if you do understand how to use UITableView, I don't think it's going to be too hard in using the project.
